My journey with Gitcoin began as a grant recipient via CryptoConexion, evolving into a multifaceted role encompassing education, project coordination, and active community participation. \n\nThrough my project, CryptoConexion which launched October 31, 2021, I have dedicated myself to demystifying blockchain technology. Since being introduced to Gitcoin , we have been fostering the adoption of Gitcoin‚Äôs initiatives, contributing significantly towards building a resilient and knowledgeable Web3 community.\n\nContribution to Gitcoin's Essential Intents:\n\nNetwork Effects:\nMy project, CryptoConexion, stands at the forefront of welcoming newcomers into the Web3 space and accompanying them in their journey. We have successfully onboarded numerous individuals and projects into the Gitcoin ecosystem, directly contributing to the expansion of product adoption. A testament to this effort is the coordination of a Gitcoin funding round designed to incentivize the creation of innovative Web3 tools. This initiative not only spurred project participation but also played a critical role in enhancing the ecosystem's network effects, aligning perfectly with Gitcoin‚Äôs goal of growth through collaboration.\n\nKey to the work we do is also ensure there is gender inclusion, which is why we were one of the co-founding members of WAGMI LATAM, an initiative to onboard Latinas to Web3. In addition, we are proud to say that approximately 47% of visitors to CryptoConexion are women. \n\nCommunity First:\nCommunity lies at the heart of everything I do. We have built a strong community at Gitcoin both in LatAm and globally and I personally credit Gitcoin with building a network of communities that uplifted us throughout 2023 by providing support, guidance and promoting our work. This is also what we do with the more than 40 communities we collaborate with globally, many which we connected with via Gitcoin. \n\nIn addition, in 2023 we had actively supported Twitter spaces, including hosting an hour+ of content daily in English and Spanish during LetsGrowLive during GG19. \n\nMy commitment to promoting various projects and donating during Gitcoin‚Äôs GG18 and GG19 showcases my belief in the power of community-driven progress and my dedication to fostering a culture of support and engagement within Gitcoin. \n\nFinancial Longevity:\nEducation is the cornerstone of sustainable growth. Through CryptoConexion, I have led the creation and publication of tutorials and articles aimed at educating the community about Gitcoin and the broader Web3 ecosystem. This effort directly contributes to Gitcoin‚Äôs financial longevity by ensuring a steady influx of informed and engaged community members, ready to contribute to and benefit from the ecosystem.\n\nIn addition, we have supported various projects and provided funding for a grant initiative on Gitcoin. \n\nImpact Evidence:\nMy contributions are quantified by the tangible impact they have had on the community and the Gitcoin ecosystem:\nEducational articles on CryptoConexion have collectively reached thousands of readers, sparking interest and engagement in Gitcoin: \nhttps://cryptoconexion.com/que-es-gitcoin/)\nhttps://cryptoconexion.com/que-es-el-quadratic-funding\n\nThe Twitter spaces hosted during GG19 in Spanish significantly broadened our reach, engaging hundreds of listeners and fostering a bilingual community within Gitcoin.\n\nThe Gitcoin funding grant called ‚ÄúCommunity Alliance, Beyond Coordination‚Äù where CryptoConexion joined 11 projects in funding and driving engagement, saw the participation of numerous projects, contributing to a vibrant ecosystem of innovation and collaboration.\n\nIn addition, my unwavering commitment to Gitcoin‚Äôs mission has been evident through my continuous efforts to educate, engage, and empower the Web3 community. By aligning my work with Gitcoin‚Äôs essential intents, I have contributed to creating a self-reinforcing cycle of network effects, fostering a community-first approach, and ensuring the financial longevity of the ecosystem. \n\nI am eager to further contribute to Gitcoin‚Äôs vision, driving positive impact via coordination and collaboration and meaningful engagement across the Web3 landscape.\n","ProjectId":3239,"Project Github":null,"Project Website":"https://cryptoconexion.com/"},

The round feature projects making a significant impact on the African continent. It was also the first round in the history of Gitcoin focused on Africa during a Grant season. \nThe round was a resounding success that featured impact projects and brought many donors into the Gitcoin space. \n\nhttps://reportcards.gitcoin.co/10/0xD309DeFD59C0b8792b14197EaA40043D9625B22B \n\nThank you for considering this proposal. My journey with Gitcoin, underscored by the successful management of the independent round during GG19 and various community-centric initiatives, represents my commitment to fostering public goods and my dedication to leveraging the Gitcoin platform to create a tangible impact, especially within the African continent.

ReFi Local Nodes - Gitcoin Featured Rounds in 2023:**\n\n- **Objective:** Establish and expand a network of ReFi local nodes that serve as community hubs for regenerative economy initiatives, leveraging Web3 technologies to support local projects with global implications.\n- **Impact:** Beginning in April 2023 with the¬†[Local Node Beta Round](https://blog.refidao.com/local-node-applications-are-open/), we initiated a $25k match funding pool to support the establishment of an initial cohort of nodes, primarily in the Global South. This effort led to the creation of 14 new nodes, all of which became part of an 8-week¬†[Alpha Cohort incubation program](https://blog.refidao.com/announcing-the-refi-dao-local-node-prize/). Following this, the¬†[ReFi Local Node Beta Cohort](https://blog.refidao.com/local-node-applications-are-open/)¬†kicked off in Gitcoin Grants 18 (GG18) Round in August 2023 with an additional $30k in match funding.

SQF‚Äôs continuous structure enables open-ended quadratic matching ‚Äúrounds.‚Äù This structure can relieve pressure to consolidate grantee/donor activity into grueling two-week sprints (we‚Äôve all been there), support high-conviction donor-grantee relationships (think supercharged Patreon), and provide grantees with immediate, more predictable capital so they can focus on impact. \n\nThe Geo Web, Superfluid, and Gitcoin Allo implemented SQF as a proof-of-concept Allo v2 Strategy: https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/tree/main/contracts/strategies/_poc/sqf-superfluid. Its first use case is to allocate the Geo Web‚Äôs partial common ownership land market funds (and other grant funds) at https://geoweb.land/governance. The pilot is live on Optimism and runs from February 21 to April 21, 2024.\n\nWe believe that SQF is a prime example of an innovative, community-initiated project that can help drive Gitcoin‚Äôs network effects and public good impact. The strategy, UI, and supporting tooling are open-source and intended to mature into broad use! SQF uses onchain Passports that generate direct revenue for Gitcoin (until that group spins off?).\n\n**My Contributions**\n- I developed the open-source Streaming Quadratic Funding pilot UI at https://geoweb.land/governance\n- Main PR: https://github.com/Geo-Web-Project/cadastre/pull/471 & many more to https://github.com/Geo-Web-Project/cadastre.\n- My UI work included creating the animated Sankey diagram, dynamic $/speed scaling, contract integrations, mobile responsiveness, checkout flow iteration, Gitcoin Passport integration, extensive testing, and more.\n- I wrote the [multi-sig compatible deployment scripts for the Allo strategy & round admin operations](https://github.com/Geo-Web-Project/sqf-deployment-scripts) and led the technical process.\n- I debugged and provided the fix for a bug within the Allo v2 SQF strategy contracts: https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/pull/469 \n- I added privacy-preserving analytics to the SQF UI to aid continuous product/UX improvement. \n\n**Project Impact**\n- We went from launching a far-out idea one week to being highlighted as an [allocation strategy for the Gitcoin 2.0 Vision](https://x.com/gitcoin/status/1763727147536208364?s=20) in the very next one.\n- Our [launch Tweet thread](https://x.com/thegeoweb/status/1760320354394771577?s=20) has been viewed 29k+ times and retweeted 49 times. Our [Twitter space](https://x.com/thegeoweb/status/1760363637313540582?s=20) has been listened to 324 times and counting.\n- As of writing, there are 42 direct donation streams and 4 third-party streams to the matching pool in the [pilot round](https://geoweb.land/governance).

The first one focused on promoting the community to know everything about the project and the second one to create applications within Arbiutrum.\n\nA-Talent Round: \n\nI applied for a Talent Protocol Grant where my project was the community. I allocated 100% of the grant, which was 1000 USD for the creation of a Gitcoin round where we managed to get more than 3800 USD of donations.

SQF‚Äôs continuous structure enables open-ended quadratic matching ‚Äúrounds.‚Äù This structure can relieve pressure to consolidate grantee/donor activity into grueling two-week sprints (we‚Äôve all been there), support high-conviction donor-grantee relationships (think supercharged Patreon), and provide grantees with immediate, more predictable capital so they can focus on impact. \n\nThe Geo Web, Superfluid, and Gitcoin Allo implemented SQF as a proof-of-concept Allo V2 Strategy: https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/tree/main/contracts/strategies/_poc/sqf-superfluid. Its first use case is to allocate the Geo Web‚Äôs partial common ownership land market funds (and other grant funds) at https://geoweb.land/governance. The pilot is live on Optimism and runs from February 21 to April 21, 2024.\n\nWe believe that SQF is a prime example of an innovative, community-initiated project that can help drive Gitcoin‚Äôs network effects and public good impact. The strategy, UI, and supporting tooling are open-source and intended to mature into broad use! SQF uses onchain Passports that generate direct revenue for Gitcoin (until that group spins off?).\n\n**My Contributions**\n- I wrote the [SQF product requirements document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F_TNdXmBgNjPf6cDdumB_Rvu6dtzq0o34nqfTgJDBMU/edit#heading=h.ocll8k11cabk) to initiate the project and managed the specs/requirements to completion.\n- I created the [initial UI designs in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/EDhPLz4mS4lIRiFRe0aYxV/SQF?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=kxlIyyHNtfRtMQ7a-0).\n- I was the primary user tester and [documentation writer](https://docs.geoweb.network/concepts/streaming-quadratic-funding).\n- I was the project hype man writing the [launch blog post](https://mirror.xyz/geoweb.eth/54RLkPhmWIcWP4B8QFlYbVY_M-fxaNqjqZF-5pe3WdI), [Twitter thread](https://x.com/thegeoweb/status/1760320354394771577?s=20), and multiple grant proposals to increase the matching pool funds([1 big success!](https://publicnouns.wtf/vote/36)). \n- I gave a [talk about SQF at ETHDenver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ym7qaSK1mKE) and another at [GreenPill Network side event](https://partiful.com/e/CcjcwgSLF8aTkx6bJmQG).\n- I‚Äôve continued to demo SQF and shared how Allo v2 can be used in new allocation strategies on community calls like RadicalxChange, OP Community Demo Day, and RegenLearnings. \n\n**Project Impact**\n- We went from launching a far-out idea one week to being highlighted as an [allocation strategy for the Gitcoin 2.0 Vision](https://x.com/gitcoin/status/1763727147536208364?s=20) in the very next one.\n- Our [launch Tweet thread](https://x.com/thegeoweb/status/1760320354394771577?s=20) has been viewed 29k+ times and retweeted 49 times. Our [Twitter space](https://x.com/thegeoweb/status/1760363637313540582?s=20) has been listened to 324 times and counting.\n- As of writing, there are 42 direct donation streams and 4 third-party streams to the matching pool in the [pilot round](https://geoweb.land/governance). You should go open a stream right now too :) \n- We‚Äôre supporting Allo v2 use and experimentation.

To revolutionize how donors identify and support grantees during PGF rounds.\n\n### The Challenge: \nIn large PGF rounds, where hundreds of grantees vie for attention, the brightest spotlight often falls on those with the strongest marketing. This imbalance creates a cycle where deserving projects may go unnoticed, leading to an uneven distribution of resources and opportunities.\n\n### The Result: \nThis disparity not only places additional burdens on grantees to amplify their visibility but also diverts their focus from creating meaningful impact. As a result, the true potential of PGF is left untapped, and innovation in public goods is stifled.\n\n### Our Solution: GrantsScope\nWe believe in leveling the playing field. GrantsScope harnesses the power of data analytics, machine learning, and advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance project visibility and democratize access to funding. Our experiments are designed to assist donors during quadratic funding rounds on Gitcoin Grants by\n- Providing personalized recommendations, helping donors easily navigate the complexity of PGF rounds.\n- Offering self-discovery tools that empower donors to explore and connect with projects that resonate with their values.\n- Reducing information asymmetry, ensuring donors comprehensively understand the PGF landscape.\n\n### Our Impact: \nThe apps developed and deployed since Citizens Retro Round #2 are as follows:\n- March 2024: [Clustering-based Discovery tool](https://gp-octant.streamlit.app/) for GreenPill Network x Octant Community Round\n- January 2024: PoCs for [Grantee Recommendations Engine](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/concepts-pocs-and-early-results-for-personalized-grantee-recommendations/17469)\n- December 2023: [Code-created NFT](https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0x4e17da9659cca38ebfd98446d2b404bf94fe9997/1) art to illustrate power of PGF\n- December 2023: [2023 Wrapped](https://2023-wrapped-gitcoin.streamlit.app/) with Personalized Grantee Recommendations for Gitcoin Donors\n- November 2023:  [Conversational App](https://all-about-gg19.streamlit.app/) for 500+ projects in GG19 ‚Äì Program Rounds and Climate Solutions Rounds\n\nVisit https://grantsscope.xyz/ to access the complete list of apps, source code, and sample results.\n\nJoin a growing community of over 500 unique users, as verified by StreamLit analytics, in exploring innovative applications that leverage conversational experiences using LLMs (Large Language Models) and clustering techniques.\n\n### What's next?\nAs the next milestone, GrantsScope will utilize existing onchain data and clustering techniques to offer personalized recommendations to donors in Gitcoin Grants (GG20) in April 2024.\n\n### The Team: \nRohit Malekar currently maintains this project as a single-person team.

I organized and managed the Qortal grant in GG19 (and plan to do so again in GG20), helping to educate people about the Gitcoin system, and ensuring the donations were safely and properly transferred to the Qortal Community Fund. Furthermore, I have mirrored several Gitcoin websites to the Qortal Data Network (QDN), allowing the community to more directly access documentation, and creating a decentralized and distributed archive of this information.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, my project revolves around fostering a far-reaching and inclusive Gitcoin community.

Also each host that wants to come on video received a training video.\n- It‚Äôs an intricate setup because it requires both a phone & computer to be used.

This meant I was live practically every waking hour. While on dates (sorry not sorry), on my 30th birthday (this was actually a huge highlight), at the grocery store, it was literally 24/7 as my computer was running while I slept. There were inevitably some people that didn‚Äôt show up on Sundays & I did my best to fill in these gaps as well. \n‚Ä®‚Ä®\n**GROWcabulary**\n- Pioneered the GROWnation meme, making donating on Gitcoin fun & shining light on how Grants = Growth before that was officially a thing\n- Enforced the use of this term through sirens on spaces & the 'GROW Police'\n- I made the memes & it caught on!‚Ä®‚Ä®\n![Memes](https://i.postimg.cc/DZKwq5qx/Copy-of-Let-s-Grow-Live-Social-Media-post-8.png)\n\n**Gitcoin Citizen Spaces Summaries:**\n- During the Gitcoin Citizen spaces, Umar & Kris mentioned that they would like the action items summarised from the spaces.

Let‚Äôs GROW Live. Participation in Gitcoin‚Äôs Ecosystem also GROWs because we onboarded many onto Gitcoin Passport & celebrated live GROWnations. \n2) Through community activation & creating 350 hours of live broadcasting of video content, we stewarded the Gitcoin brand & grew brand love within the Gitcoin ecosystem.\n\nLet‚Äôs GROW Live also directly contributed to 2 of the 3 Essential Intents:\n1) Network Effects: Through cross pollination, we deeply engaged a variety of communities in participating in Let‚Äôs GROW Live. By being live on 17 social media channels, we unlocked extraordinary network effects. \n2) Community First: Let‚Äôs GROW Live cultivated a strong community that genuinely feels like a family.

Over the past 12 years, I've been busy building up projects, NGOs, and businesses in Split, Croatia. My biggest achievements? Starting the [Youth Club Split](https://klubmladihsplit.hr) and [BlockSplit conference](https://blocksplit.net). I also helped get [Split Tech City](https://split-techcity.com) and [Include](https://include.eu) off the ground. My latest endeavor is [Zubar](https://zubar.hr), aimed at fixing problems in the [dental market](https://documentation.denther.com).\n\nIn 2017, I discovered Ethereum and quickly saw its potential. This led me to start local blockchain meetups in Split, which eventually grew into the BlockSplit conference ‚Äì now the region's most significant web3 event. I'm passionate about tackling big challenges, especially when I can take the lead. I don't know where the future will take me, but I sure hope to significantly contribute to Ethereum.\n\nFrom August 2023, I have been working on a new project - [Municipal Quadratic Funding Initiative](https://muqa.org) . Implementing quadratic funding in a city. In the first couple of months, my work was funded by Gitcoin trough Funding the Commons, but after that funding ran out, I continued working on the project voluntarily.\n\nBesides MUQA, I have been a member of [Gitcoin DeSci Community Round](https://t.me/gitcoindesci) Operations team. In this role, I have been actively involved in all decision making and work.","ProjectId":3211,"Project Github":null,"Project Website":"https://x.com/tomislavmamic"},
